    <reviewbody>Clean up this stuff, what's the point of having junk online. Anyone can leave their cheap digital camera on for four seconds at a time and upload it in 3000kbps quality 20fps and show turning around in their home.</reviewbody>
    <reviewtitle>Clean it up please</reviewtitle>

    <reviewbody>Crap like this keeps the real films from getting a chance to be seen.  Thank God i have earned enough money, to start placing my films at other websites such as atom films, videoart.net, and hopefully the Cannes Film Festival.
If not i know I have earned enough to start placing my films at other legitimate sites.</reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>Congratulation, ignore the haters, composition perfect, subject matter relevant, camera motion fluid and free. This stairway makes the old Zeppelin song sound like mary had a little lamb.</reviewbody>
